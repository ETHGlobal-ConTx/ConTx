## Deployments
You can find the schema resolver we wrote for EAS functionality deployed on these chains:

Base Goerli: https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xc400c8adf58ccecf226681f6cc18cc5dd20d0a32 \
Arbitrum Goerli: https://goerli.arbiscan.io/address/0x3a713ebf897324cd41cf7096df57117f90c48a08 \
Linea Goerli: https://goerli.lineascan.build/address/0x2c320e8b6254e6ad650a4ec469a030931195bf8b \

The primary purpose of the resolver in EAS is to only allow our back-end wallet key to make attestations with our schema
